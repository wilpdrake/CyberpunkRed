      <p>
        A biking glove that comes with a subdermal grip pre-installed* which requires
        a neural link to use. Has 1 additional cyberarm option slot. Any options
        stored in the Cyberhand or meat hand are inaccessible while the Smart Glove is
        being worn.<br /><em
          >*Subdermal Grip must be added and installed manually after acquiring the
          glove, this effectively consumes one of the option slots.</em
