      <p>
        An impressively affordable cyberchair, offering great features at this price
        point. While using it the operator's base MOVE becomes 5, with all regular
        movement options remaining available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Operation of the cyberchair requires either a free hand, or interface plugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the operator suffers a critical injury that reduces their MOVE, the MOVE of
        the cyberchair is instead effected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cyberchair cannot be targeted specifically, nor can it be disabled via EMP
        effects.
