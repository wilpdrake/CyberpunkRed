      <p>
        An affordable and balanced Cyberdeck for novice Netrunners. Though limited by
        its modest hardware specs, it retains the advanced safety features of
        Kirama&rsquo;s flagship Cyberdecks.
      </p>
      <p>5 slots only for Programs.</p>
      <p>
        Only one of each Program category can be installed at a time (Attacker,
        Defender, Booster, Black ICE). Netrunner suffers no negative effects from an
        Unsafe Jack Out.
