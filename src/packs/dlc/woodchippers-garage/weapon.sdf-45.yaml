      <p>
        This rocket launcher can only load Armor-Piercing rockets, and has a maximum
        range of 400 m/yds. When fired one rocket at a time, the GM chooses where they
        rockets land. When fired two rockets at a time, the GM chooses where the
        rockets land but this time up to 50 m/yds away from the target, and with each
        rocket more than 10 m/yds from each other.
