  description:
    value: |
      <p>
        Comes with an Exotic Grenade Launcher Underbarrel* which - as the main gun is
        poor quality - functions as a poor quality weapon. It can't be removed. Both
        that and the main weapon can fire non-Basic Ammunition.
      </p>
      <p><em>*Must be manually added after acquiring the weapon</em></p>
