  description:
    value: |
      <p>
        Rather than normal shotgun ammunition, this weapon fires whatever liquid is
        placed into it. Acid can be bought for 10eb (Cheap) that reduces all armour
        worn by the target by 1 SP. Poison or Biotoxin can also be loaded, though
        requires 3 vials per shot.
      </p>
