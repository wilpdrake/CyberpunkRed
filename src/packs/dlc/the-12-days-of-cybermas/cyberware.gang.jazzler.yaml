      <p>
        Use a Choke Action to stab a grappled target with a popout electrified needle.
        The target takes no damage but must make a
        <strong>DV13 Resist Torture/Drugs</strong> Check. On failed check, target
        falls Unconscious for 1 minute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Powered by a rechargeable battery pack (50eb). Battery pack must be recharged
        for 1 hour after each use. No check is necessary to conceal Gang Jazzler and
        battery pack. Can be installed in meat arm if it's the only piece of cyberware
        in that arm.
