      <p>
        Single-optic Cybereye visor that takes the place of two meat eyes. Too large
        for a MultiOptic Mount.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cybereye Options are always "paired" even if there is only one of each type.
        Penalties from Lost Eye Critical Injury are doubled if the target solely
        relies on the Monovision for sight.
