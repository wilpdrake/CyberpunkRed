        This additive allows a Vial of Poison or Biotoxin to be absorbed through skin
        contact. One vial can cover 2 square feet when applied to a surface and lasts
        for one hour. Can be neutralized by rinsing with water.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first meat target to touch the affected area with a meat body part is
        dosed with the poison. A <strong>DV17 Perception</strong> check reveals the
        poison. More than one dose in the same 2 square foot area has no added effect.
