      <p>Cyberarm Option. Takes 2 option slots.</p>
      <p>
        Gas Jet sprays a burst of 3 doses of a Street Drug or 3 Vials of
        Poison/Biotoxin into a 3x3 square directly in front of the shooter (similar to
        Shotgun Shell attack). Can be used one-handed and is virtually undetectable
        even without a Conceal check.
      </p>
      <p>
        All susceptible targets in range suffer the effects of the drug or poison.
        Targets equipped with gear that neutralizes gas attacks (Nasal Filters &amp;
        Anti-Smog Breathing Mask) are not affected. Gas Jet must be loaded with 3 more
        doses after each shot before firing again.
