  The Fool. All of the target's cyberware is inoperable for 1 hour. Their Checks
  gain the "Obscured by Darkness" modifier if it would leave them with no way to
  sense an enemy. Cyberlimbs affected will act as their dismembered meat
  counterpart, but are still attached to the target's body. If the target
  doesn't have any cyberware, they are dealt the Foreign Object Critical Injury
  and take 3d6 Humanity Loss instead. (See Night City Tarot Page 3).
