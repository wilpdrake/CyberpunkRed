  The Star. If the Attack was a Ranged Attack, it hits the target and hits a
  second target within 20 m/yards that is chosen by the GM. If there is no valid
  second target, it hits the first target another time. The second hit hits the
  body. You roll a new Damage Roll for the second hit. If the Attack was a Melee
  Attack, the target is dealt the Broken Ribs and Collapsed Lung Critical
  Injuries. (See Night City Tarot Page 5).
