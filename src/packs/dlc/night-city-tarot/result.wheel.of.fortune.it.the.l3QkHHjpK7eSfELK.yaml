  Wheel of Fortune. It the Attack was a Ranged Attack, the GM randomly selects a
  new target. If it was a Melee Attack, the Attacker falls prone and the Attack
  misses. The weapon used for the Attack malfunctions and requires an Action to
  be used to reverse the malfunction before being used again. (See Night City
  Tarot Page 4).
