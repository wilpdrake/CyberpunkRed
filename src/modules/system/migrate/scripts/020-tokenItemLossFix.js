   * make an update that hits *every* token. (See https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9939#issuecomment-1688775290
   * from Foundry staff.) Since we don't want to actually change anything, we will just set the token's name to itself with
   * an update operation where `diff: false` which will force the update regardless of whether there is a difference
   * or not.
